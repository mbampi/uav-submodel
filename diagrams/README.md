# Diagrams 

This directory contains the UML diagrams that specify the various Submodel Collections (SMC) and properties developed within the UAV Submodel (SM). These diagrams serve as a reference for understanding the structure, components, and submodels that make up the UAV's digital twin.

## Usage

These diagrams provide a visual representation of the UAV’s digital twin model, offering insight into the design and organization of the Submodel Collections and their properties. They are essential for understanding the structure and interconnections within the UAV's AAS.

Use these diagrams to guide the development, analysis, or documentation of the UAV’s digital twin. They can be used alongside the AASX files found in the [AASX_Files](../AASX_Files) directory for a comprehensive understanding of the model.
